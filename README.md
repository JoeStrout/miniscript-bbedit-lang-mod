# miniscript-bbedit-lang-mod
[MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) language model for [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (a high-end Mac text editor)

This is a syntax coloring language module for BBEdit for use when editing a MiniScript source file.

To install, select "Language Modules" from the BBEdit menu, Folders submenu.  That will open the Language Modules folder in the Finder.  Drag the miniscript-language-module.plist file into this folder, and restart BBEdit.

To use it when editing a MiniScript file, simply change the language popup menu in the lower left corner of the BBEdit window to "MiniScript" and the syntax coloring should take effect.
