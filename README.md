# miniscript-bbedit-lang-mod
[MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) language model for [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (a high-end Mac text editor)

This is a syntax coloring language module for BBEdit for use when editing a MiniScript source file.

To install, simply place the miniscript-language-module.plist file (or a symlink to it) inside the following folder:

`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/`

If the "Language Modules" folder does not exist, you need to create it.

To use it when editing a MiniScript file, simply change the language popup menu in the lower left corner of the BBEdit window to "MiniScript" and the syntax coloring should take effect.

Suggestions and pull requests are always welcome.  Share and enjoy!
